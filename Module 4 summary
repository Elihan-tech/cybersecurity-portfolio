# ðŸ“˜ Module 4 Summary â€” Tools of the Trade: Linux and SQL

## ðŸ”¹ Key Concepts Learned
- Understood how logs record system events and how security analysts use them to detect threats.  
- Explored how SIEM tools collect, filter, and analyze logs from multiple sources.  
- Learned about network monitoring tools, including protocol analyzers (packet sniffers) and intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS).  
- Practiced using the Linux command line to navigate the file system, manage permissions, and monitor processes.

## ðŸ”¹ My Takeaways
This module showed me how important it is to have theright toolsfor the job. Logs, SIEMs, and packet analyzers all work together to give visibility into whatâ€™s happening inside a network. I also saw how Linux is central to cybersecurity tasks, and practicing commands gave me a better feel for the systems Iâ€™ll be working with in the future.
