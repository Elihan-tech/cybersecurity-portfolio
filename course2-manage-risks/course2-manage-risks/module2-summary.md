# Course 2 - Module 2 Summary: Security Audits and Controls

## What I Learned
In this module, I learned what an internal security audit is and why organizations use them to measure their security posture. I also learned about different types of security controls: **administrative**, **technical**, and **physical controls**. These controls work together to reduce risk and protect systems, people, and data.

## Example from the Module
For example, during an internal audit, a company might discover that employees are not following password policies. This is a **human-related weakness**, so the solution would be an **administrative control** like updating the policy and requiring security awareness training. If needed, the company could also add **technical controls** like enforcing password requirements through system settings.

## Personal Takeaway
This module helped me understand how important it is to regularly check security defenses instead of assuming everything is safe. Audits help find weaknesses before attackers do, and security controls give organizations a structured way to protect their assets.
