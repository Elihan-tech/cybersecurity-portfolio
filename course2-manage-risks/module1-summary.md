# Course 2 - Module 1 Summary: Security Domains and Risk

## What I Learned
In this module, I learned about security domains and how they organize cybersecurity work into different areas like risk management, security operations, and access control. I was also introduced to the Risk Management Framework (RMF), which is a process organizations use to identify and manage security risks so they can protect their systems and data.

## Example from the Module
One example that made sense to me was how a company might discover that employees are reusing weak passwords. This is a vulnerability that could be exploited by attackers. To reduce the risk, the company could enforce stronger password policies and add multi-factor authentication for better protection.

## Personal Takeaway
This module showed me that cybersecurity isnâ€™t just about tools and technology. It also involves understanding risk and making smart decisions that keep a business safe. Good security planning helps prevent problems before they happen.
