# Course 2 - Module 3 Summary: Security Tools and SIEM

## What I Learned
In this module, I learned how SIEM tools collect and organize logs from different systems to help security teams spot issues faster. I also learned about the different types of SIEM setups—self-hosted, cloud-hosted, and hybrid—and how each one works depending on what an organization needs. The module also covered why logs are important and how they can be used to understand what happened during a security event.

## Example from the Module
An example that made sense was how a SIEM can connect a spike in traffic from a suspicious IP with errors on a web server. Seeing those events together makes it easier to figure out whether the problem is a cyberattack or a system failure.

## My Takeaway
This module showed me how important SIEM tools are for monitoring and responding to incidents. They help save time, reduce guesswork, and give analysts a clearer picture of what’s happening in a network. I’m starting to understand how logs and alerts fit into the daily work of a SOC analyst.
