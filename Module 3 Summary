# ðŸ“˜ Module 3 Summary â€” Protecting Against Threats, Risks, and Vulnerabilities

## ðŸ”¹ Key Concepts Learned
- Understood the difference between **threats, vulnerabilities, and risks**:  
  - *Threat* = potential danger (like a hacker or malware)  
  - *Vulnerability* = weakness that could be exploited (like an unpatched system)  
  - *Risk* = the chance of a threat exploiting a vulnerability and causing harm  
- Learned about **common attack methods**:  
  - Phishing, spear phishing, whaling, vishing, smishing  
  - Malware (viruses, worms, ransomware, spyware)  
  - Social engineering tactics (USB baiting, impersonation, watering hole attacks)  
- Explored why **social engineering is effective**, including psychological principles like authority, urgency, intimidation, scarcity, and trust.

## ðŸ”¹ Example Threat
**Ransomware Attack:**  
Attackers encrypt an organizationâ€™s files and demand payment (often in cryptocurrency) to restore access. This type of attack demonstrates how vulnerabilities can be exploited to cause financial and operational damage.

## ðŸ”¹ My Takeaways
This module showed me how attackers think and why itâ€™s important to understand both the **technical and human side of cybersecurity**. Technology alone isnâ€™t enough â€” people are often the weakest link. The examples of social engineering stood out to me because they showed how attackers rely on psychology, not just coding, to gain access. It reinforced the need for both strong security tools and ongoing employee awareness training.
